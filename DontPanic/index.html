                <p> You awake with a gasp. You blink trying to clear your vision. The floor under your feet is cold. As you regain your sight, you see that you are in a small room. The floors are wood panels that creak with every movement.  There are two doors, one with light radiating from beneath it and one that is open slightly.  You hear something and need to start moving. Don’t panic. </p>
                <br />

                <p> You slowly walk into the next room. You look around you and notice that the room is everything but a couch and a barred window. You don’t know why you are here or how you got here but you need to get out. There is something here. Something is stalking you. You look to your left and see a door out to the balcony and to your right is a bathroom. You know what the right option is but you still consider going in the bathroom. </p>

                <p>You stumble into the next room and see that it is much brighter in here.  You hear a large bang as the door slams behind you. You quickly turn around and see nothing. You frantically look around and still see nothing. Directly in front of you there is a set of stairs that might go outside.  You look down and see a trap door that seems to be unlocked.  Even though going deeper into house seems like a bad idea, you still consider it to be an option. </p>

                <p> You step out onto the balcony. There isn’t anything out here other than an upside down glass and an old wooden railing. You hear something below the balcony and something inside says it’s a good Idea to look over the edge. There also appears to be something beneath the glass. </p>
